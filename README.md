# 🌀 Sphiral Engine: Topological AI Framework

**Experimental AI architecture based on Anti-Symmetry and S-Inversion logic.**
*Based on the research of Oleg Basargin.*

### 📖 About
Current AI models (Transformers) work on statistical prediction. **Sphiral Engine** works on **Topological Balance**.
Instead of bits (0/1), it uses **Bingles** (Bi-Chiral Tensors) — dynamic units of meaning that exist only as a tension between Thesis ($V_+$) and Antithesis ($V_-$).

### 🚀 Key Features
1.  **S-Logic:** Decisions are made via S-Inversion (collisions of opposite spins).
2.  **Anti-Symmetry:** Information is stored not as a value, but as a standing wave between opposite vectors.
3.  **Negentropy:** The system tends towards balance (Null Point), requiring minimal energy to maintain "memory mass".

### 🧬 The DNA of Sphiral AI
* **Bingle:** The basic unit of memory (Thesis + Antithesis + Spin).
* **Interaction:**
    * *Different Spin* (+/-) → **Synthesis** (Birth of new concept).
    * *Same Spin* (+/+) → **Alliance** (Reinforcement).

### 💻 Usage
Run the interactive dialogue core:
```bash
python sphiral_core.py
